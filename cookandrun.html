A running dinner event is an event where you team up with a partner and invite two other teams consisting of strangers to your appartment and cook a delicious meal for them. In exchange two other teams will prepare a meal for your team. At the end all teams come together for a big after party. It&rsquo;s especially popular in student cities. At my university such a running dinner event takes place every semester with more than 3000 students. I wanted to build a platform to help organize such events with minimal effort.</p> <h2>Key challenges</h2> <ol> <li>Teams must have an appartment in a certain area to make sure that every team can reach the next appartment in time.</li> <li>At every stage teams should come together who haven&rsquo;t met each other before.</li> </ol> <h2>How does it work?</h2> <ol> <li>Organizer signs up at www.cookandrun.fun <img alt=demo width=1552 height=909 src="images/project_cookandrun/01-c3370496.png"/><br></li> <li>Organizer signs in <img alt=demo width=1552 height=909 src="images/project_cookandrun/02-a59ef25c.png"/></li> <li>Organizer creates a new event <img alt=demo width=1552 height=909 src="images/project_cookandrun/03-c61ef967.png"/></li> <li>Organizer specifies more details for the event <img alt=demo width=1552 height=909 src="images/project_cookandrun/04-dee61f7a.png"/> E.g. specify the area in which the participants need to have an appartment. Participants who don&rsquo;t live in the specified area won&rsquo;t be allowed to sign up for the event <img alt=demo width=1552 height=909 src="images/project_cookandrun/05-2f17c114.png"/></li> <li>Organizer opens the registration phase <img alt=demo width=1552 height=909 src="images/project_cookandrun/06-19461683.png"/></li> <li>Participants can now sign up <specified subdomain>.cookandrun.fun <img alt=demo width=1552 height=909 src="images/project_cookandrun/07-a6d2f48e.png"/></li> <li>Organizer closes the registration phase <img alt=demo width=1552 height=909 src="images/project_cookandrun/08-242b249d.png"/></li> <li><p>Organizer draws the teams <img alt=demo width=1552 height=909 src="images/project_cookandrun/09-f85a390c.png"/> The goal is that all teams who share a meal together are as close together as possible. I used K-means algorithm with a fixed cluster size to achieve a near optimal result. <img alt=demo width=1552 height=909 src="images/project_cookandrun/10-04f4a9f3.png"/></p></li> <li><p>Organizer starts event <img alt=demo width=1552 height=909 src="images/project_cookandrun/11-efa43c38.png"/></p></li> <li><p>After the event is started participants get access to their individual time table for the event <img alt=demo width=1552 height=909 src="images/project_cookandrun/12-0e0c445f.png"/></p></li> </ol> <h2>Technical challenges</h2> <h3>1. Dynamic subdomains</h3> <p>Each event should get its own subdomain for participants to sign up. I split the platform into two seperate applications. The first application serves all requests from cookdandrun.fun. The second application is responsible for all requests from <subdomain>.cookandrun.fun. Both use the flask framework and share the same database.</p> <h3>2. Restrict event area</h3> <p>The goal was to make it dead easy for an organizer to specify an area in which all participants need to live in order to be allowed to sign up. I use Google Maps for visualization and the Google Maps API to get the coordinates for an address and check whether it&rsquo;s within the specified area or not</p> <h3>3. Deployment &amp; mail server</h3> <p>Currently the project is deployed on a free tier instance on AWS via four docker containers (2 web apps container, database container and nignx container). As far as the mail server is concerned I couldn&rsquo;t use a normal mail providers (zoho or gmail) because they limit the number of outgoing emails. Eventually I went with the Simple Email Service (SES) from AWS. If you are using AWS to host your application then the first 62.000 emails are free each month. That&rsquo;s more than enough for this project. So the current operating costs are $0.</p> <h2>Code</h2> <p>You can find the code on github. In order to use it you need to change your configs (mail server, etc).</p> <div class=ending> <p> As always, I would love to hear your feedback!<br> Shoot me an email: info(at)janruettinger.com </p> </div> </section> </div> <footer class=footer> </footer> </body> </html>
