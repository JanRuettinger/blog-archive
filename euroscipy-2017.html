It was fist developer conference ever that I attended. In the following I want to briefly describe my expierence, followed by some fan pics and a few take aways at the end.</p> <h2 id=conference-overview>Conference overview</h2> <p>The program to the conference can be found <a href="https://www.euroscipy.org/2017/program.html">here</a>.<br/> Every talk was recorded and uploaded on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToYFc_AcKU0&amp;list=PLYHT2hHT8PFC03gijYx1HqEIpVov0tmXy">Youtube</a>.</p> <p>On the first two days there were only tutorials. They had a beginner track and an advanced track. I switched back and forth between the two (see program link).</p> <p>Julia Rohrer gave the keynote “How to Fix a Scientific Culture: Psychology as a Cautionary Tale and Paragon” of the conference. I didn’t expect the scientific culture to bad that bad. She talked about p-hacking (= use of creative methods to make the outcome of your experiment statistical significant) and how the current system of grant distribution causes bad behavior among scientist.</p> <h3 id=talks-i-liked>Talks I liked</h3> <ul> <li>Interactive 3D Visualization in Jupyter Notebooks by Vidar Tonaas Fauske</li> <li>GeoPandas - geospatial data in Python made easy by Joris Van den Bossche</li> <li>Testing the unknown: how to test scientific codes by Alice Harpole</li> <li>Bayesian Optimization - Can you do better than randomly guessing parameters? by Tim Head</li> </ul> <h2 id=meeting-scipy-core-developers>Meeting scipy core developers</h2> <p>Tim Head (<a href="https://twitter.com/betatim">@betatim</a>) is a core contributor to <a href="https://github.com/scikit-optimize">scikit-optimize</a>.<br/> He gave a very informative talk about Bayesian Optimization. As Tim also enjoys running, we went for a run together in the morning of the second day. <img alt=01 width=600 height=564 src="images/euroscipy/01-64b9cec2.png"/></p> <p>Olivier Grisel (<a href="https://twitter.com/ogrisel">@ogrisel</a>) is contributor to scikit-learn.<br/> Olivier is a really funny guy and thus quite approachable. He publishes most of his tutorials on github which are very helpful. <img alt=02 width=600 height=688 src="images/euroscipy/02-0ca55bc8.png"/></p> <p>Joris Van den Bossche (<a href="https://github.com/jorisvandenbossche">github</a>) is a core contributor to <a href="https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas">pandas</a>. <br/> He sat down with me for a couple of minutes to give me some tips ron how to solve an optimization problem for a <a href="janruettinger.com/cookandrun">site project</a>. <img alt=03 width=600 height=450 src="images/euroscipy/03-110d5da9.png"/></p> <p>Soumith Chintala (<a href="https://twitter.com/soumithchintala">@soumithchintala</a> is a core contributor to <a href="https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch">PyTorch</a>.<br/> <img alt=04 width=600 height=563 src="images/euroscipy/04-3c1d6408.png"/></p> <h2 id=take-aways-from-a-first-timer>Take aways from a first timer</h2> <ol> <li>Bring your own problems (side projects, academic projects, …)<br/> People tend to enjoy discussing a concrete problem much more than a broad question which you could google anyway.</li> <li>Don’t focus too much on the talks<br/> All the talks will be recorded and uploded but the people will be gone. If you get along with a person really well, I think it’s not a bad idea to skip a talk entirely.</li> <li>Prepare questions beforehand<br/> Sometimes I was just overwhelmed by the talk and was afraid to ask silly questions. That’s why it’s a good idea to spend some minutes with the material before the conference.</li> </ol> <h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2> <p>My high expectations were satisfied. I didn’t know anybody when I arrived and left with some new friends. The conference helped me to get a much better understanding of the scientific programming ecosystem in Python. The conference also helped me to get an idea whether I would enjoy working as a software developer or not.</p> <div class=ending> <p> As always, I would love to hear your feedback!<br> Shoot me an email: info(at)janruettinger.com </p> </div> </section> </div> <footer class=footer> </footer> </body> </html>
