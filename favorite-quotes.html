Don't feel harmed – and you haven't been."<br/> <strong>Marcus Aurelius</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>"It's not about you, but how you react that matters."<br/> <strong>Epictetus</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>"You are what you do, so what are you right NOW?"<br/> <strong>Manuel Gondzales</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>"By living in the Bay Area you are basically agreeing to be a beta tester for all the crazy ways we’ll live in the future."<br/> <strong>Aaron Levie</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>"Early stage VC is a lot like baseball, if you get a hit one out of every three times, you are headed to the hall of fame.”<br/> <strong>Fred Wilson</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Boyd’s Law: "speed of iteration beats quality of iteration."<br/> <strong>John Boyd</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>"You know that old saw about a plane flying from California to Hawaii being off course 99% of the time—but constantly correcting? The same is true of successful startups—except they may start out heading toward Alaska."<br/> <strong>Evan Williams</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>“if you’re not embarrassed by your first release, you’ve launched too late.”<br/> <strong>Reid Hoffman</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>“People don’t want to buy a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-inch hole!”<br/> <strong>Theodore Levitt</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>"The sum total of our efforts—which included hundreds of cold calls, tens of thousands of emails (I was invited to a “top 20 customers” dinner with TK from Tout), seminars, an appearance on FOX News Live, ads, reaching out to our personal networks as well as the Blueprint Health mentor network—was one paying doctor (who later went out of business) and a handshake deal to partner with a small 20-year-old EMR.<br/> <strong>Jeff Novich</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>"If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses." <strong>Henry Ford</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>"As far as the customer is concerned, the interface is the product."<br/> <strong>Jeff Raskin</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>"Most people make the mistake of thinking design is what it looks like. People think it’s this veneer—that the designers are handed this box and told, Make it look good! That’s not what we think design is. It’s not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works."<br/> <strong>Steve Jobs</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>"The process of programming subverts the process of making easy-to-use products for the simple reason that the goals of the programmer and the goals of the user are dramatically different. The programmer wants the construction process to be smooth and easy. The user wants the interaction with the program to be smooth and easy. These two objectives almost never result in the same program."<br/> <strong>Alan Cooper</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>“I suppose it is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail”<br/> <strong>Abraham Maslow</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>"Don’t design for the average person: The actual Average User is kept in a hermetically sealed vault at the International Bureau of Standards in Geneva."<br/> <strong>Steve Krug</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>"I would have written a shorter letter, but I did not have the time."<br/> <strong>Blaise Pascal</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>“Perfection is attained not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing more to remove.”<br/> <strong>Antoine de Saint Exupéry</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>… solve problems so that, “you’re not aware really of the solution [and] you’re not aware of how hard the problem was that was eventually solved”<br/> <strong>Johnathan Ive</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>"Good artists copy; great artists steal."<br/> <strong>Steve Jobs</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>“An MVP is a version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort”<br/> <strong>Eric Ries</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>“It’s much easier to take a product that a small number of users love and get a lot more users to love it than it is to take a product that a large number of users like and get them to love it”<br/> <strong>Paul Graham</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>I ask [my customers], “If the product were free, how many would you actually deploy or use?” The goal is to take pricing away as an issue and see whether the product itself gets customers excited. If it does, I follow up with my next question: “Ok, it’s not free. In fact, imagine I charged you $1 million. Would you buy it?” While this may sound like a facetious dialog, I use it all the time. Why? Because more than half the time customers will say something like, “Steve, you’re out of your mind. This product isn’t worth more than $250,000.” I’ve just gotten customers to tell me how much they are willing to pay. Wow.<br/> <strong>Steve Blank</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>"Perhaps the biggest thing preventing founders from realizing how attentive they could be to their users is that they’ve never experienced such attention themselves. Their standards for customer service have been set by the companies they’ve been customers of, which are mostly big ones. Tim Cook doesn’t send you a hand-written note after you buy a laptop. He can’t. But you can. That’s one advantage of being small: you can provide a level of service no big company can. Once you realize that existing conventions are not the upper bound on user experience, it’s interesting in a very pleasant way to think about how far you could go to delight your users."<br/> <strong>Paul Graham</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>"A user interface is like a joke. If you have to explain it, it’s not that good."<br/> <strong>Martin LeBlanc</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>"I’ve missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I’ve lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I’ve been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I’ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed."<br/> <strong>Michael Jordan</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>There is a classic story of Pablo Picasso traveling on train when a passenger recognizes him and asks, “Why do you distort reality in your art instead of painting people the way they actually are?” Picasso asks, “What do you mean by the way they actually are?” The passenger pulls out a photo of his wife from his wallet and says, “Well, this is what my wife actually looks like.” Picasso looks at the image and says, “She’s rather small and flat, isn’t she?”<br/> <strong>Pablo Picasso</strong></p> </blockquote> <div class=ending> <p> As always, I would love to hear your feedback!<br> Shoot me an email: hello@janruettinger.co </p> </div> </section> </div> <footer class=footer> </footer> </body> </html>
