Since then I have been following Y-Combinator, the startup accelerator he co-founded, closely. It became my dream to join the Y-Combinator family one day. </p> <p>I am aware of the fact that there are several top accelerator programs out there which are doing a great job as well. </p> <h2>Pillars of my strategy for the next two years</h2> <ul> <li>If you want to build a great company, you need a great product.</li> <li>If you want to have a great product, you have to iterate a lot.</li> <li>If you want to iterate a lot, you need quick iteration cycles.</li> <li>If you want to have quick iteration cycles, you need to be able to write good code really fast.<br> <i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right"></i> Speed wins!<br></li> </ul> <p>In the next two years I will focus mainly on my software development skills.</p> <h3>Concrete steps</h3> <ul> <li>Become a really good Full Stack Developer</li> <li>Finish my studies in Electrical Engineering</li> <li>Move to Silicon Valley and work for a tech giant for a few years to build a network</li> <li>Start a company</li> <li>Get into YC</li> </ul> <p>Right now, I am in Chiang Mai (Thailand) to work on my goals without distraction.</p> <h3>What am I doing in Chiang Mai?</h3> <p>I basically work on three things: </p> <ol> <li><p><strong>Blog</strong><br> Write some articles for my blog to improve my communication and language skills. My literature teacher won&rsquo;t believe it, but I actually do enjoy writing now ;-) </p></li> <li><p><strong>Programming skills</strong><br> Going through some tutorials and write some code for a side project.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Product skills</strong><br> I work on a side project called &ldquo;HabitControl&rdquo;. I use it to improve my product skills. I basically interview random people here and ask for feedback. After some tests, I will experiment with some launching strategies on hackernews. Just to get a basic understanding of what works and what doensn&rsquo;t.</p></li> </ol> <p>I will update this post from time to time.</p> <p><strong>&mdash; 05/20/2016 &mdash;</strong> {: style=&ldquo;color: red; text-align: center;&rdquo;} </p> <p>I am back in Germany now continuing my studies. </p> <div class=ending> <p> As always, I would love to hear your feedback!<br> Shoot me an email: info(at)janruettinger.com </p> </div> </section> </div> <footer class=footer> </footer> </body> </html>
