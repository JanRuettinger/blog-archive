His website was just awesome - I was stunned! Then I looked at his code and everything was so clean!</p> <blockquote> <p>"Good artists copy; great artists steal" <strong>Steve Jobs</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>I am still a novice developer, so I thought well copying the elements you like is okay ;-)</p> <h2 id=version-1-was-born>Version 1 was born</h2> <p><img alt=blog_v1_index src="/images/images/blog_v1_index.png"/></p> <p><img alt=blog_v1_index src="/images/images/blog_v1_footer.png"/></p> <p><img alt=blog_v1_index src="/images/images/blog_v1_projects.png"/></p> <p>When I finished the first version, I was definitely proud of myself. However I quickly realized that this structure was not the right one for me. I didn't like user flow (too complicated) and the focus was different. He designed his website to get paying clients for his freelance work. My goals are different.</p> <h2 id=version-2---restart>Version 2 - Restart</h2> <p>I did some more research and started again.</p> <p><img alt=blog_v2_index src="/images/images/blog_v2_index.png"/></p> <p>This version is even more minimalistic. So far I still like it. I guess that's an important point. If you do not like your website you probably won't post as much.</p> <h3 id=what-kind-of-setup-do-i-use>What kind of setup do I use?</h3> <ul> <li> <p><u>Backend:</u> Ruby on Rails</p> </li> <li> <p><u>Frontend:</u> Bootstrap (only required components), no JS so far</p> </li> <li> <p><u>Domain:</u> Free .co domain from a Hackathon</p> </li> <li> <p><u>Hoster:</u> Heroku</p> </li> <li> <p><u>Version Control:</u> Git</p> </li> <li> <p><u>Text Editor:</u> Sublime Text 2</p> </li> <li> <p><u>Computer:</u> Mac book Air (2014) without external mouse or keyboard</p> </li> </ul> <h2 id=version-3---static-site>Version 3 - Static site</h2> <p>Recently I did some more changes under the hood.
