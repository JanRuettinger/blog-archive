If you want an education, go to the library.”<br/> <strong>Frank Zappa</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>“Choose not to be harmed – and you won’t feel harmed. Don’t feel harmed – and you haven’t been.”<br/> <strong>Marcus Aurelius</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>“It’s not about you, but how you react that matters.”<br/> <strong>Epictetus</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Boyd’s Law: “speed of iteration beats quality of iteration.”<br/> <strong>John Boyd</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>“You know that old saw about a plane flying from California to Hawaii being off course 99% of the time—but constantly correcting? The same is true of successful startups—except they may start out heading toward Alaska.”<br/> <strong>Evan Williams</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>“if you’re not embarrassed by your first release, you’ve launched too late.”<br/> <strong>Reid Hoffman</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>“People don’t want to buy a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-inch hole!”<br/> <strong>Theodore Levitt</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>“If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.”<br/> <strong>Henry Ford</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>“As far as the customer is concerned, the interface is the product.”<br/> <strong>Jeff Raskin</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>“Most people make the mistake of thinking design is what it looks like. People think it’s this veneer—that the designers are handed this box and told, Make it look good! That’s not what we think design is. It’s not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.”<br/> <strong>Steve Jobs</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>“The process of programming subverts the process of making easy-to-use products for the simple reason that the goals of the programmer and the goals of the user are dramatically different. The programmer wants the construction process to be smooth and easy. The user wants the interaction with the program to be smooth and easy. These two objectives almost never result in the same program.”<br/> <strong>Alan Cooper</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>“I suppose it is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail”<br/> <strong>Abraham Maslow</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>“Don’t design for the average person: The actual Average User is kept in a hermetically sealed vault at the International Bureau of Standards in Geneva.”<br/> <strong>Steve Krug</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>“I would have written a shorter letter, but I did not have the time.”<br/> <strong>Blaise Pascal</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>“Perfection is attained not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing more to remove.”<br/> <strong>Antoine de Saint Exupéry</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>… solve problems so that, “you’re not aware really of the solution [and] you’re not aware of how hard the problem was that was eventually solved”<br/> <strong>Johnathan Ive</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>“An MVP is a version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort”<br/> <strong>Eric Ries</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>“It’s much easier to take a product that a small number of users love and get a lot more users to love it than it is to take a product that a large number of users like and get them to love it”<br/> <strong>Paul Graham</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>“A user interface is like a joke. If you have to explain it, it’s not that good.”<br/> <strong>Martin LeBlanc</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>“I’ve missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I’ve lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I’ve been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I’ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.”<br/> <strong>Michael Jordan</strong></p> </blockquote> <div class=ending> <div id=disqus_thread></div> <script>
